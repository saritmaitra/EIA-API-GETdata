"""f-strings are interesting; but as flexibility increases, so does the potential for exploits
We have used string format here which is a bit cumbersome because it requires an import statement and it is less flexible with types. 
It also doesnâ€™t evaluate Python statements the way f-strings do. 
These constraints make template strings an excellent choice when dealing with user input."""
